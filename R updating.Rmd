```

For updating the R software first install the package "installr" by Tal Galili.

The installation can be conducted using the Rstudio with the command **install.packages()**.

```{r}
#install.packages(installr).
```


Exit the Rstudio and open the newest R software on your computer (e.g. R x64 4.0.3).
At the basic R IDE, load the **installr** package using the **library** command.
```{r}
library(installr)
```

Execute the command **installr()** and follow the instructions. 
```{r}
# installr()
```

You can check for available Rstudio update using the Tab **Help** -> **Check for updates**. 
The updating process is by installing Rstudio manually again from [this website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
